A command-line tool that computes the next version from git history,
assembles and renders its changelog, and stages the release on a stage branch
for review. It is paired with a Claude Code plugin that authors the changelog
prose.

The specification corpus under [`specs/`](specs/) is the source of truth: the
features' FRDs, the [container](specs/containers/release-cli/release-cli-container.md)
and [module](specs/modules/release-core/release-core-module.md) blueprints, and
the [command surface contract](specs/contracts/release-cli-contract.md).

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/brettcallaghan/release/cmd/release@latest
```

## Development

```bash
go test ./...                    # unit, snapshot and end-to-end tests
scripts/ci.sh                    # everything a push must pass
scripts/regenerate-snapshots.sh  # rewrite testdata/ from the implementation
scripts/coverage.sh              # measure coverage and update this README
```

Work is tracked with [beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) on the
`beads/data` branch. After cloning, run `./scripts/beads-setup.sh` once; see
`AGENTS.md`.

## Test coverage

Three layers exercise the CLI, measured separately and merged:

- **Unit** — each package's own tests.
- **Snapshot** — the data-driven cases under `testdata/cases/` and the golden
  help under `testdata/help/`, replayed in-process against the command tree.
- **End-to-end** — the `release` binary, built with `go build -cover` and run
  as a process.

A statement is covered if any layer reaches it.
